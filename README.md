# Stoplight Desktop App

Looking for the latest and greatest visual editor from Stoplight? Check out [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/)

This is a wrapper around the Stoplight Platform, that makes certain native functionality available to it. It also starts and manages a local instance Prism on your computer for you.

**Download the latest release in the [GitHub releases tab](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/releases).**

For support, see our [community forum](https://community.stoplight.io/). For support that includes private account information, email [support@stoplight.io](mailto:support@stoplight.io).

> Note: This repo will appear to not be updated often, but this is because it is a wrapper around the Stoplight web app. We have monthly releases, see our Changelog [here](https://community.stoplight.io/tags/changelog).

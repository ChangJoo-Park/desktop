# Stoplight Desktop App

This is a wrapper around the Stoplight Platform, that makes certain native functionality available to it. It also starts and manages a local instance Prism on your computer for you.

> Note: This repo will appear to not be updated often, but this is because it is a wrapper around the Stoplight web app. We have monthly releases, see our Changelog [here](https://community.stoplight.io/tags/changelog).
